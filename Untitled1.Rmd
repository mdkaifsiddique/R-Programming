## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

df=data.frame(x,y)

```

```{R}
x=c(1,2,3,4)

matrix(x,nrow=2,ncol=2)
m1=matrix(x)

dimnames(m1)=list(c("A","B"),c("C","D"))

```

x=c(1,2,6,7,3,4,5,9,10,11,12)

x2=c("apple","banana","guava","cherry")

x3=c(TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE)

x5=c(1,2,3,4,5)
rep(x5,each=2)


x6=c("A","B","c")
x6
rep(x6,c(2,3,4))
#or
rep(c("A","B","C"),times=c(2,3,4))
#for repeat
rep(c(1,2,3),c(2,6,7))
